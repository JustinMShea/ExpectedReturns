#' @section Potentially Missing Data:
#'
#' In the Fama-Franch factors data series missing data are indicated by \eqn{-99.0},
#' \eqn{-99.99} or \eqn{-999}. Which value is actually used really depends by the
#' context and the data set at hand, we recommend looking any of those values with
#' suspicion, especially for real-world business use cases when even one basis point
#' count.
