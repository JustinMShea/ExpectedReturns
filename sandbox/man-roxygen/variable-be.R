#' @section BE variable:
#'
#' *Book equity*, denoted \eqn{BE}, is a firms' financial variable that Fama-French
#' construct from Compustat data or is collected from the *Moody's Industrial, Financial, and Utilities manuals*.
#' \eqn{BE} is the book value of stockholders' equity, plus balance sheet deferred
#' taxes and investment tax credit (if available), minus the book value of preferred
#' stock. Depending on availability, they use the redemption, liquidation, or par
#' value (in that order) to estimate the book value of preferred stock.
#' Stockholders' equity could be reported by Moody's or Compustat, otherwise the
#' authors measure stockholders' equity as the book value of common equity plus
#' the par value of preferred stock, or the book value of assets minus total
#' liabilities (in that order).
