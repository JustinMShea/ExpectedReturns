In the following we briefly review \textcite{asness-frazzini-2013} (AF hereafter) 
and reproduce this work thanks to replication data sets publicly available. Data 
are updated and maintained by AQR (www.aqr.com).
As will be clear from further discussions, for their analysis authors use data until
2010 or 2011, depending on the specific value measures being constructed, compared,
and analyzed.
Updated data sets go beyond the time frame originally covered in the paper, the 
most recent data are until May, 31, 2020. First observations dates vary by country,
the United States have the longer data series in the sample with the first observation 
reported on July, 31, 1926.

### Value measures
Introducing the value measures contemplated in this work, the first value measure 
studied is the standard practice pioneered by \textcite{fama-french-1992}. It is 
the most widely used measure in the literature and as such it is also referred to 
as the "standard method". 
The Fama-French value measure is defined
$$
bp_{t}^{a,l} = \ln(B/P_{fye})
$$
where $B$ is the book value per share and $P_{fye}$ indicates
the price variable at the end of the fiscal year (rather than in June), both quantities
are expressed in local currency. Note that superscripts $a$ and $l$ indicate respectively
that this measure is annual (it is updated once a year) and lagged (prices are six 
to 18 months prior to date, not current prices). The $B/P$ ratio, at times denoted 
$BM$ is commonly known as the book-to-market ratio.

The second and third values measures, original of this work, are slight modifications 
of the standard method. As we will outline in further sections, these measures indeed 
resemble most of the authors research focus: should analysts or investors use lagged 
price in constructing valuation ratios?
The measures, expressed in local currency, are
$$
bp_{t}^{a,c} = \ln(B^*/P_t)
$$
and
$$
bp_{t}^{m,c} = \ln(B^*/P_t)
$$
The superscripts have the following meaning, the former is updated annually and 
computed using current prices ($c$ superscript), whereas the latter is update monthly 
($m$ superscript) and computed using most recent prices as per the June 30 rebalance 
date ($c$, for current, superscript).
In both the two above measures $B^*$ stands for the firms' book value per share 
(or market equity value) that has been adjusted for splits, dividends, and other 
corporate actions between fiscal year-end and portfolio formation dates. In other 
words, we can express this financial variable by means of an adjustment ratio:
$$
B^* = B\frac{Adj_t}{Adj_{fye}}
$$
with $Adj$ the cumulative adjustment factor, which adjusts between the fiscal 
year-end and the current date $t$.

All the three measures above are related to one another by the following relations,
$$
bp_{t}^{a,c} = bp_{t}^{a,l} - r_{fye,t}
$$
$$
bp_{t}^{m,c} = bp_{t}^{a,c} - r_{t,t+k}
$$
where 
$$
r_{t,s} = \ln(1 + R_{t,s})
$$
is the total log return between date $t$ and $t < s$. 

### Portfolio construction
<!--
I have already re-elaborated and shared more or less all about Fama-French Three-factor 
definitions and construction from their website. 
We can:
- simply retrieve those definitions here as well;
- discuss them only in the usual Fama-French model in its own section above (preferred).
Anyways, this is precisely why that method was used and time invested in doing so.
NOTE: This holds for U.S. calculation based factors, *not* for the International sample.
For the latter I'll add details and will be straightforward as well thereafter.
(see here meanwhile: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#International)

All portfolio returns are in USD, excess returns are returns above the U.S. Treasury bill rate.

The $HML^{devil}$ factor introduced by the authors is constructed from value-weighted portfolios with size/book-to-market breakpoints updated every calendar month. Portfolios are rebalanced every calendar month to maintain weights. The factor is defined as the average return on the two values portfolios minus the average return on the two growth portfolios, 
$$
HML^{devil} = \frac{1}{2}[(\textrm{Small Value} + \textrm{Big Value}) - (\textrm{Small Growth} + \textrm{Big Growth})]
$$


### What Proxies Best for the True Unobservable Book-to-market ratio?

The authors propose a less lagged version of the standard $BP_{t-1}^{a,l}$, which 
they define
$$
BP_{t-1}^{a,c} = \frac{B_{t-1}}{P_{t,(June)}}
$$

> "We show that using a more-current price is superior to the standard method of using prices at fiscal year-end as a proxy for the true B/P ratio, and superior in five-factor model regressions."
- Asness-Frazzini (2013, p. 49)

> "Does the fallen price make this more likely, less likely, or have no effect on whether this should be considered a value stock?
The answer depends on how much variation in B/P ratios is due to expected returns and how much is due to changes in future book values. Our findings show that true value stocks often show such price drops, and a measure that takes this fall into consideration, as our proposed method does, is superior to one that ignores it, as the standard method does."
- Asness-Frazzini (2013, pp. 49-50)

<!-- (DATA: where is book equity?)
To reproduce these results I need more data than currently available. 
Authors provide ME in the data sets you parsed, but BE is needed as well to get BMs.

Now, it seems to me that FactorsAnalytics' 'factorDataSetDjia5Yrs' data contains
P2B for DJIA companies so we may in principle recover data from there. 
But I don't think it's enough, it's not the same assets universe.
From the authors ("DATA, METHODOLOGY, AND TERMINOLOGY", p. 50):
"Our U.S. equity data includes all available common stocks on the merged CRSP/XpressFeed 
data between July 1950 and March 2011."

Doing some research I found that the great Prof. French shares BE data for the US.
(http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#Breakpoints).
Couldn't find anything close to the "International sample".

### Which Book-to-market ratio Form Better Value Portfolios? 

Country portfolios are aggregated into international and global portfolios using the country's total market capitalization as of the prior month. Further details are provided by \textcite{asness-frazzini-2013} in *Exhibit A1*.
In the construction of their original "International sample" (or "Global ex US"), \textcite{asness-frazzini-2013} included the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Latest data provided by AQR, extends this list of countries with Ireland, Israel, and Portugal. We study the full panel of countries in the newest International sample, restricting attention to the original sample would certainly be possible but requires explicit weighting of country series. The "Global sample" includes the United States of America as well.

The only $STR$ data available is with respect to the US. We were, and are, obtaining this data from Prof. Kenneth R. French's data library and thus it only contemplates the US. 
Admittedly, authors omit to provide this factor data series altogether in their replication data sets (see note 18 for a motivation). This is, after all, consistent with their analysis, there isn't anything "wrong" per se. However, if we are to compare results among US, International, and Global sample, it would - of course - be unfeasible to make such a comparison while including the $STR$ for the US only.

### Value and momentum interaction
<!--
This is the reason last Saturday we were discussing to start from "Value and Momentum Everywhere". 
The same or very similar arguments, plus some of Ilmanen's "broader themes" (such as the liquidity factor), are discussed and analyzed in more depth. This fact is indicated by authors themselves, see p. 936 of "Value and Momentum Everywhere".
- Vito
-->
The paper also highlights important aspects on the dynamics between value and 
momentum strategies. In section 3 authors add that:
> "...in the presence of momentum, and for logical reasons having to do with the overlap of our value measure and the period used to form momentum, our more timely value measure also outperforms the more standard lagged measure."
- Asness-Frazzini (2013, p. 56)

## Additional value factors

Inspired by the recent Cliff Assness discussion and AQR paper by the same title, 
Let's model the value factors he lists. We have some of these factors already
in FactorAnaltyics data sets.
