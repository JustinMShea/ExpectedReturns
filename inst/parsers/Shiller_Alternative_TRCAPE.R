## Shiller Alternative CAPE ##
# From the website:
# "As of September 2018, I now also include an alternative version of CAPE that
# is somewhat different. As documented in Bunn & Shiller (2014) and Jivraj and
# Shiller (2017), changes in corporate payout policy (i. e. share repurchases
# rather than dividends have now become a dominant approach in the United States
# for cash distribution to shareholders) may affect the level of the CAPE ratio
# through changing the growth rate of earnings per share. This subsequently may
# affect the average of the real earnings per share used in the CAPE ratio. A total
# return CAPE corrects for this bias through reinvesting dividends into the price
# index and appropriately scaling the earnings per share.
